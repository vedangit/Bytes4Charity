# NGO-website

HI! So this was me and my partner's first ever full scale website build. Both of us arent really that experienced in WebDev apart from having a grasp of the basics of html, css and js.
Making this website was really fun! It was very hectic and tedious too but the overall result was satisfactory. We both learnt a lot in this!

Stack used :- 
- Frontend -> HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Database -> Firebase

- **TO RUN THE WEBSITE, use "index.html"**
- Remember to access the donor dashboard by creating an account and choosing the 'Donor' role 👍
- Member role users are normal users wihtout any additional privileges
